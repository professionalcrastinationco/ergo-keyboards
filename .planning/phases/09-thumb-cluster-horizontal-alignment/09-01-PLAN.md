<objective>
Adjust thumb cluster horizontal positioning so inner thumb keys align vertically with specific main columns (Layer Up with T/G/B on left, TAB/Symbols with Y/H/N on right).

Purpose: Match the visual layout to the actual Choc keyboard physical layout for accurate reference.
Output: Updated CSS positioning so thumb clusters sit inward, with increased gap between halves to prevent overlap.

**Reference image:** D:\APPS\KEYBOARDS\image.png shows the target alignment:
- Left thumb: NavNum key should align vertically with T/G/B column (column 5 of left half)
- Right thumb: TAB/Symbols key should align vertically with Y/H/N column (column 2 of right half, which is Y at top)

**Current structure:**
- `.keyboard-container` has `gap: 60px` between left and right halves
- `.thumb-cluster` uses `justify-content: flex-end` (left) / `flex-start` (right)
- Each half is a CSS grid: `repeat(6, 54px)` columns with `6px` gap
- Thumb cluster spans all 6 columns: `grid-column: span 6`

**Key insight:**
- Currently thumb clusters align to outer edges of each half
- Need to shift them INWARD toward center gap
- Must increase center gap to prevent inner thumb keys (Space/Enter) from overlapping

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Phase 8.2: Thumb rotation angles are already correct - don't change rotation
- Vanilla CSS only, no frameworks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Increase center gap and shift thumb clusters inward</name>
  <files>styles.css</files>
  <action>
    1. Increase `.keyboard-container` gap from 60px to ~100px to make room for inward thumb shift
    2. Add margin-right to `.thumb-cluster` (left side) to shift it toward center (inward)
    3. Add margin-left to `.thumb-cluster.right` to shift it toward center (inward)
    4. Calculate offsets: Each column is 54px + 6px gap = 60px. To align NavNum with column 5 (T/G/B), need to shift thumb cluster right by approximately 1-2 columns worth (~60-120px). Fine-tune by visual inspection.
    5. Test that Space/Enter keys don't overlap in center gap

    DO NOT change rotation angles (those are correct from Phase 8.2).

  <verify>Open index.html in browser, visually compare to reference image - NavNum should align with T key column, TAB/Symbols with Y key column</verify>
  <done>Thumb clusters visually align with reference image columns, no overlap in center</done>

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open index.html in browser
    2. Compare to reference image D:\APPS\KEYBOARDS\image.png
    3. Verify LEFT side: NavNum key aligns vertically with T/G/B column
    4. Verify RIGHT side: TAB/Symbols key aligns vertically with Y/H/N column
    5. Verify: Space and Enter keys do NOT overlap in the center gap
    6. Test at different zoom levels to ensure alignment holds
    7. Switch between layers - thumb positions should remain consistent

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] Thumb clusters shifted inward toward center
- [ ] NavNum aligns with T/G/B column on left
- [ ] TAB/Symbols aligns with Y/H/N column on right
- [ ] Space and Enter keys don't overlap
- [ ] Rotation angles unchanged from Phase 8.2
- [ ] Layout works at multiple zoom levels

<success_criteria>
- Thumb cluster horizontal alignment matches reference image
- No key overlap in center gap
- Visual layout accurately represents Choc keyboard
- All existing functionality preserved (selection, editing, combos)
